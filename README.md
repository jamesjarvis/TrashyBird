This is a simple FlappyBird clone project.

I was bored one night and decided to challenge myself a little bit, as well as get better used to git and IntelliJ.

Coded in Java simply because I was the most comfortable in that language.

## Directions to run:
Create the compile directory
```
mkdir out/production/
```
Then compile
```$xslt
javac src/* -d out/production/
```
Then run
```$xslt
java -classpath out/production/ TrashyBird
```
